# EventManagementAPI

## Introduction: 

This is a basic REST API which allows the user to handle and manipulate events. This can be deployed with a frontend to fetch records, create new users and events, list the events, waitlists for an event,etc... </br>
It has seven routes:  </br>
1. Create Event. </br>
2. Delete Event. </br>
3. List upcoming events. </br>
4. Create User. </br>
5. Delete User. </br>
6. Attend Event (for a logged in user).  </br>
7. Get Attendees of an event.  </br>

## Setup Instructions:  </br>

1. Clone this repository on your system.  </br>
2. Check out the package.json file and first install node and run npm install from the command line.This will install the dependencies.  </br>
3. Run npm start from the command line and server starts on the port 3000.(If you want to change this, create a dot.env file and create a variable PORT and assign it the value. </br>

The best way to test this is using Postman and making API calls while going through the documentation.
